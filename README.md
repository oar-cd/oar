# Oar

Self-hosted Docker Compose project management with GitOps workflows. All the benefits of declarative deployments without Kubernetes complexity.

## Why Oar?

Turn your Git repositories into the single source of truth for Docker Compose deployments. Push to Git, and Oar automatically syncs your running services - no manual deployments, no configuration drift.

- **GitOps Made Simple**: ArgoCD-style automation for Docker Compose
- **Zero Configuration Drift**: Git commits automatically trigger deployments
- **Self-Hosted**: Complete control over your deployment infrastructure
- **Zero Setup**: Works with existing Compose files

## Installation, upgrade

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/oar-cd/oar/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```
